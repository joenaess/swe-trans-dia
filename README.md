# Swedish Transcription and Diarization with WhisperX FastAPI API

This repository contains a FastAPI application that provides speech-to-text transcription for Swedish, alignment, and speaker diarization using the `whisperx` library.

## Features

* **Transcription:** Transcribes audio files using the KBLab/kb-whisper-large Whisper model.
* **Alignment:** Aligns the transcribed text with the audio to provide word-level timestamps.
* **Speaker Diarization:** Identifies different speakers in the audio and labels the transcribed segments accordingly.

## Requirements

* NVIDIA GPU with CUDA drivers (for optimal performance)
* Docker
* Docker Compose

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/joenaess/swe-trans-dia.git](https://github.com/joenaess/swe-trans-dia.git)

2. **Build the Docker image:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose build --no-cache

3. **Create a .env file in the root directory and add your Hugging Face token, the token should have been apporved for pyannote (https://huggingface.co/pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.1):**
   ```bash
   HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN=your_huggingface_token


4. **Start the FastAPI server:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d

5. **Send a POST request to the /transcribe/ endpoint with your audio file:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST -F "file=@audio.wav" "http://localhost:8000/transcribe/?min_speakers=2&max_speakers=2"
